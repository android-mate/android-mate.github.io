org.ligi.survivalmanual,ui.MainActivity,:id/contentRecycler,android.widget.TextView,This section will give you some information regarding this application. But if you are in a survival situation right now - please skip this blurb and jump directly to the section that contains the information for your immediate problem/need.##This app is intended to guide you in rough times but it can also be used to have fun outdoors and to learn things that are useful even outside a survival situation. The fun parts are also useful in training important skills for potential survival situations. Reading is only one factor - practice and understanding are also needed to increase your chances of survival.##The app is based on the FM 3-05.70 Field Manual - but now it is a wiki (think of it as the Wikipedia of survival) so it is easy to improve the content. That said when you see something that can be improved- or if you find that something is missing- step up and improve the content!##Also- if you are able to illustrate: I am currently adding new sections and am unable to illustrate. E.g. the new section on Power could use some images of wind and water generators (for example). It is important to keep the images small - ideally they will be vector images - but black & white images as the other ones in this app also work. The file-sizes should be small so that people do not uninstall their Survival App to make space and forget to re-install it later. This app should always be less than 10Mb in size so people can just keep it on their phones without really worrying about it.##There will be updates to content and the app - please join the BetaTesters to give feedback and get the newest stuff first.##This app is free and libre software under GPLv3. You can find the source-code on github - Pull-Requests are very welcome! However- before doing big changes please contact me so that there is no work done in vain.##If you have a question please check out the FAQ - perhaps your question is already answered there.##If you have any feedback or a question please join the google+ community I would also love it if people could share their adventures in pictures and or text there!##Thanks to everyone that made this app possible! You can find some of them in the credits.##If you want to support this app: please rate it and maybe have a look at the support options on my homepage or get some of the survival equipment you still need via my Amazon affiliate links (like the Solar USB Charger- Lifestraw water filter- Leatherman OHT MultiTool) If you already have everything and no money you could get the free audible trial and e.g. listen to the great audio book "the Martian". This is a beautiful survival story from another planet!##Also on a personal note: Please let's work towards a future where such a manual is not needed that much. Let's protect the environment and stop all wars so humans are not forced to go through bad times and need to fight for survival. Let's just live in peace in a beautiful- intact world!-)##That said- happy surviving - live long and prosper! With the hope that you never get in such trouble that you really need this guide- have fun preparing for potential situations and learning.##http://ligi.de##,DUPLICATE_CLICKABLE_BOUNDS_FLAW,

You only need a converter to 5V/USB - you can build one yourself or buy one. Be careful here though - there are some really bad converters out there.

org.ligi.survivalmanual,ui.MainActivity,:id/contentRecycler-child-0:android.widget.TextView,android.widget.TextView,WATER##Your body loses water through normal body processes (sweating- urinating- and defecating). During average daily exertion when the atmospheric temperature is 20 degrees Celsius (C) (68 degrees Fahrenheit [F])- the average adult loses and therefore requires 2 to 3 liters of water daily. Other factors- such as heat exposure- cold exposure- intense activity- high altitude- burns- or illness- can cause your body to lose more water. You must replace this water.##Dehydration results from inadequate replacement of lost body fluids. It decreases your efficiency and- if you are injured- it increases your susceptibility to severe shock. Consider the following results of body fluid loss:##‣ A 5-percent loss results in thirst- irritability- nausea- and weakness.#‣ A 10-percent loss results in dizziness- headache- inability to walk- and a tingling sensation in the limbs.#‣ A 15-percent loss results in dim vision- painful urination- swollen tongue- deafness- and a numb feeling in the skin.#‣ A loss greater than 15 percent may result in death.##The most common signs and symptoms of dehydration are:##‣ Dark urine with a very strong odor.#‣ Low urine output.#‣ Dark- sunken eyes.#‣ Fatigue.#‣ Emotional instability.#‣ Loss of skin elasticity.#‣ Delayed capillary refill in fingernail beds.#‣ Trench line down center of tongue.#‣ Thirst. (Last on the list because you are already 2-percent dehydrated by the time you crave fluids.)##You should replace the water as you lose it. Trying to make up a deficit is difficult in a survival situation- and thirst is not a sign of how much water you need.##Most people cannot comfortably drink more than 1 liter of water at a time. So- even when not thirsty- drink small amounts of water at regular intervals each hour to prevent dehydration.##If you are under physical and mental stress or subject to severe conditions- increase your water intake. Drink enough liquids to maintain a urine output of at least 0.5 liters every 24 hours.##In any situation where food intake is low- drink 6 to 8 liters of water per day. In an extreme climate- especially an arid one- the average person can lose 2.5 to 3.5 liters of water per hour. In this type of climate- you should drink 8 to 12 ounces of water every 30 minutes. It is better to regulate water loss through work or rest cycles because overhydration can occur if water intake exceed 1 1/2 quarts per hour. Overhydration can cause low serum sodium levels resulting in cerebral and pulmonary edema- which can lead to death.##With the loss of water there is also a loss of electrolytes (body salts). The average diet can usually keep up with these losses but in an extreme situation or illness- additional sources need to be provided. You should maintain an intake of carbohydrates and other necessary electrolytes.##Of all the physical problems encountered in a survival situation- the loss of water is the most preventable. The following are basic guidelines for the prevention of dehydration:##‣ Always drink water when eating. Water is used and consumed as a part of the digestion process and can lead to dehydration.#‣ Acclimatize. The body performs more efficiently in extreme conditions when acclimatized.#‣ Conserve sweat- not water. Limit sweat-producing activities but drink water.#‣ Ration water. Until you find a suitable source- ration your sweat- not your water. Limit activity and heat gain or loss.##You can estimate fluid loss by several means. A field dressing holds about 0.25 liters (1/4 canteen) of fluid. A soaked T-shirt holds 0.5 to 0.75 liters.##You can also use the pulse and breathing rate to estimate fluid loss. Use the following as a guide:##‣ With a 0.75-liter loss the wrist pulse rate will be under 100 beats per minute and the breathing rate 12 to 20 breaths per minute.#‣ With a 0.75- to 1.5-liter loss the pulse rate will be 100 to 120 beats per minute and 20 to 30 breaths per minute.#‣ With a 1.
