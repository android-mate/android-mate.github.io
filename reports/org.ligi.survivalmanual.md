And it might be easily available as most bikes already have a "generator" installed. Usually this "generator" / dynamo is there to power your lights on the bike. However- it can also charge a phone. You only need a converter to 5V/USB - you can build one yourself or buy one. Be careful here though - there are some really bad converters out there. I would recommend building one yourself.## </td>

		<td> This section will give you some information regarding this application. But if you are in a survival situation right now - please skip this blurb and jump directly to the section that contains the information for your immediate problem/need.##This app is intended to guide you in rough times but it can also be used to have fun outdoors and to learn things that are useful even outside a survival situation. The fun parts are also useful in training important skills for potential survival situations. Reading is only one factor - practice and understanding are also needed to increase your chances of survival.##The app is based on the FM 3-05.70 Field Manual - but now it is a wiki (think of it as the Wikipedia of survival) so it is easy to improve the content. That said when you see something that can be improved- or if you find that something is missing- step up and improve the content!##Also- if you are able to illustrate: I am currently adding new sections and am unable to illustrate. E.g. the new section on Power could use some images of wind and water generators (for example). It is important to keep the images small - ideally they will be vector images - but black & white images as the other ones in this app also work. The file-sizes should be small so that people do not uninstall their Survival App to make space and forget to re-install it later. This app should always be less than 10Mb in size so people can just keep it on their phones without really worrying about it.##There will be updates to content and the app - please join the BetaTesters to give feedback and get the newest stuff first.##This app is free and libre software under GPLv3. You can find the source-code on github - Pull-Requests are very welcome! However- before doing big changes please contact me so that there is no work done in vain.##If you have a question please check out the FAQ - perhaps your question is already answered there.##If you have any feedback or a question please join the google+ community I would also love it if people could share their adventures in pictures and or text there!##Thanks to everyone that made this app possible! You can find some of them in the credits.##If you want to support this app: please rate it and maybe have a look at the support options on my homepage or get some of the survival equipment you still need via my Amazon affiliate links (like the Solar USB Charger- Lifestraw water filter- Leatherman OHT MultiTool) If you already have everything and no money you could get the free audible trial and e.g. listen to the great audio book "the Martian". This is a beautiful survival story from another planet!##Also on a personal note: Please let's work towards a future where such a manual is not needed that much. Let's protect the environment and stop all wars so humans are not forced to go through bad times and need to fight for survival. Let's just live in peace in a beautiful- intact world!-)##That said- happy surviving - live long and prosper! With the hope that you never get in such trouble that you really need this guide- have fun preparing for potential situations and learning.##http://ligi.de## </td>
